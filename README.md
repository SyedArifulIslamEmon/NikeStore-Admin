iOS Admin app for Nike Store. We built a compact e-Commerce app for Nike products because, well, we love us some Jordans :wink:

The Admin App is the Store manager. Store owners can use this app to create product categories, add, edit and remove products from the store...and a lot more. (Download & install the app to find out more) :grinning:

With the client app, interested users can explore products in the store, add them to cart or favorites...etc

Keep in mind though that as we're unable to provide different server instances for everyone interested in testing out the app, all products created are stored in a central server which we have hosted. This means when you login to the app, your store might be populated with products that have been added by someone else testing the app :cry:

Authentication details for the Admin App:

`username:`nike.superuser

`password:`nike
